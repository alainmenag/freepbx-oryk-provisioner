# The provisioning endpoint

`engine/provisioner.php`, reached through a symlink in the web root, is the
only route a phone can use. It bootstraps FreePBX itself: FreePBX 16/17 sends
every session-less `config.php` request to the login page before a module's
`doConfigPageInit()` ever runs, so a public route cannot go through `config.php`
at all — `requires_auth="false"` governs menu visibility, not anonymous access.

| Request | Serves |
| --- | --- |
| `/provisioner/0004f282e824.cfg` | that profile's `.cfg` resource |
| `/provisioner/0004f282e824` | the same |
| `/provisioner/?mac=0004f282e824` | the same, for a caller with no filename to give |
| `/provisioner/0004f282e824-phone.cfg` | its `phone.cfg` resource |
| `/provisioner/0004f282e824-directory.xml` | its `directory.xml` resource |
| `/provisioner/3111-44500-001.sip.ld` | a File resource of any enabled profile, by name alone — a phone fetching firmware sends no MAC |
| `PUT /provisioner/0004f282e824-boot.log` | stores the body, when that profile has a Log resource answering to the name |

**Who is asking** is read from the path, then the query string, then an
AudioCodes `User-Agent`. **A MAC in the path always wins over `?mac=`** — which
matters for a filename that carries somebody else's MAC, such as the
`000000000000-directory.xml` a Polycom really does request: it resolves to
`000000000000` and cannot be redirected with `?mac=`.

**What they asked for** is the last segment of the path, verbatim. Which
resource of which profile that names is worked out by the module.

GET and HEAD fetch; PUT sends. A PUT needs a MAC — what a phone sends is
written to disk, so it has to be a phone this module knows — where a fetch does
not, since firmware is asked for by name alone. Anything else is a 404 and a
log line.

A MAC that is not associated, a client with no profile, a client or profile
that has been switched off, and a filename the profile does not serve are all
404s. A client that has a token and did not present it is a 401.

## How a filename is matched

A resource's name is itself a template, and it matches a request two ways:

| Written as | Matches | Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{{device.mac}}-phone.cfg` | `0004f282e824-phone.cfg` | the name is rendered with this client's values and compared to the request |
| `phone.cfg` | `0004f282e824-phone.cfg` | the name is compared to the request with this client's MAC taken off the front |

Both are the same string in the same column — the second is only what the first
becomes when it has no placeholders in it. A name written out in full wins over
one that matches only the tail. Matching ignores case throughout, and the MAC
is stripped in whichever separator style the phone used (`0004f282e824`,
`00:04:f2:82:e8:24`, `0004.f282.e824`).

**Name the main config `.cfg`.** Written that way it is matched with the MAC
taken off the front, so it answers whichever separator style the phone asks in.
`{{device.mac}}.cfg` works too, but it renders without separators and so only
answers a phone that asks that way. A profile with neither serves nothing for
`<mac>.cfg`.

Names are unique per profile, not globally — two profiles both serving a
`{{device.mac}}-phone.cfg` is the normal case.

**Content type** is taken from the extension: `.xml` is served as `text/xml`,
`.json` as `application/json`, `.cfg`/`.conf`/`.ini`/`.txt`/`.log` as
`text/plain`. Anything else is `text/plain` for a template or a log and
`application/octet-stream` for an uploaded file — sending a firmware image as
text is how it arrives corrupted.
